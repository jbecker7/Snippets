#Modal-Links

examplewebsite.com/sectionname/?modal-link=modal-link-post

examplewebsite.com is just the URL 

sectionname should be the section of the website where this link is being placed

"?modal-link=" should appear just like that

modal-link-post is the post you have made within WordPress and are going to link so that it pops up with the modal view
